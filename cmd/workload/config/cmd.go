		Use:   "config",
		Short: "Set up this project for `dr workload up`.",
		Long: `Answer a handful of questions and write the committed .datarobot.yaml
that 'dr workload up' deploys from.

The file is the platform's own workload-create spec, plus the workloadId
binding the CLI manages for you. Setup is a one-time act: with a manifest
already present, this command prints its path and exits, because editing
twelve lines of YAML beats re-answering eight questions. Delete the file to
start over.

The exceptions are the two .env flags. --import-env adds the variables the
manifest does not declare yet; --update-env brings the ones it does declare
back in line, rewriting a literal and re-sending the credential behind a
secret. Both are opt-in because .env is your local copy and is allowed to
drift: a deploy that silently picked up whatever it grew since is what this
command is built not to do.

A secret is re-sent without being compared. The platform never returns a
stored value, so nothing can tell a rotated key from an untouched one, and a
run that reported "no change" for a key you had just rotated would be worse
than one request too many.

Defaults come from wherever the truth already lives: a Dockerfile and its
EXPOSE line for a fresh project, the workload's own live spec when you bind
to one. Binding downloads that spec into the file, so a deploy from it
cannot quietly downgrade something already running.

Without a terminal, or with --yes or --output-format json, nothing prompts:
the flags answer every question and a missing one is an error that names it.
The Dockerfile track needs no flags at all when ./Dockerfile exists.
