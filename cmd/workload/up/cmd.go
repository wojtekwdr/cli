		Use:   "up",
		Short: "Deploy this project, applying only what changed.",
		Long: `Read the committed .datarobot.yaml, compare it and the working tree against
what is running, and apply the difference.

The plan is printed, then carried out. Nothing to do is "Already up to date"
and exit 0. Use --dry-run to see the plan and stop, which is also the answer
to "what would this deploy" in CI.

Only fields the manifest mentions are managed. A setting the file never names
survives every deploy, and deleting a line stops managing that field rather
than reverting it. Change something in the UI that the file does name and the
next run puts it back, and says so.

With no manifest, a terminal opens the same setup wizard 'dr workload config'
runs and continues straight into the deploy. Without a terminal it is an
error: this command never deploys by guessing.

A manifest that names a published image deploys in one call. One that asks the
platform to build creates an artifact, pushes the working tree to it and waits
for an image first, so the first deploy of such a project takes as long as the
build does. A build the deploy believes would produce the image already on the
artifact is skipped; --force-build says otherwise.

An environment variable, a port, a probe or a route is read when the container
starts, so a deploy that changes only those keeps the image the running one has
and takes seconds rather than minutes. Anything else builds: the code, the
Dockerfile, the execution environment, a container or group added, a change of
workload kind, a current version that was never built, and --force-build.

Deploying onto a workload that already exists rolls it: a new version is made
from the file and swapped in, the endpoint does not change, and the version
already serving keeps serving until the new one is ready. When that version is
locked, meaning production, an interactive run asks for the workload name to
be typed back. A run with no terminal, or --yes, rolls without asking. Locking
is one-way, so the new version is a new artifact rather than a change to the
locked one, and it is locked to match. That is why a locked workload keeps
deploying without --lock being passed again.

A change that moves only the sizing, such as a replica count or a resource
allocation, is applied in place instead. Nothing is built and no version is
made, because what the workload runs has not changed. A deploy that moves both
sends the sizing with the rollout, so the new version comes up with it.

A workload that is not ready to be deployed onto is dealt with rather than
refused. One still starting or stopping is waited out and then re-read, so the
plan is built against where it landed. A stopped one is started and then
reconciled in the same run, which is one command whether the file asks for a
start alone or for a start and a new version.

//     itself put a draft on the air and started the eight hours. Saying
//     nothing there leaves a workload running that the reader believes was
//     never touched.
//   - --lock says nothing, because the run is the remedy. This also covers a
